The **cpp-httplib** project is lightweight, so its documentation is mostly maintained directly 
in the repository and code itself. To master its advanced features, these are the best resources to refer to:

---

### 游릭 **1. Official GitHub Repository (Primary Source)**

* **Link:** [https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)
* The `README.md` is the best starting point. It includes:

    * Basic and advanced usage examples.
    * Handling requests/responses, routing, streaming, chunked transfers, SSL, multipart requests, and more.
    * Coverage of advanced topics like streaming, file serving, chunked responses, threading, SSL/TLS integration, multipart/form-data parsing, and error handling.

---

### 游릭 **2. Example Directory in GitHub Repository**

* **Link:** [examples](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/tree/master/example)
* This directory has practical examples demonstrating:

    * Chunked content handling.
    * File uploads and downloads.
    * SSL examples (HTTPS server/client).
    * Multipart form data handling.

---

### 游릭 **3. Source Code (Header File itself)**

* **File:** [httplib.h](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/blob/master/httplib.h)
* As cpp-httplib is a single-header library, the header itself is very readable.
* It includes extensive inline documentation and clear API descriptions.
* Reading through `httplib.h` directly can help you understand the full API capabilities and detailed behaviors.

---

### 游릭 **4. Unit Tests as Documentation**

* **Link:** [test directory](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/tree/master/test)
* Unit tests cover many scenarios including advanced edge cases.
* These tests often reveal undocumented behaviors or usage patterns clearly through example code.

---

### 游릭 **5. Issues and Pull Requests on GitHub**

* **Link:** [Issues and PRs](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/issues)
* Users often discuss advanced or edge-case behaviors.
* Maintainers frequently provide detailed explanations about intended behaviors, usage advice, and best practices.

---

### 游릭 **6. Community Examples and Articles**

* Occasionally, external blog posts and community tutorials appear (Medium, blogs, etc.):

    * Searching `"cpp-httplib site:medium.com OR site:dev.to OR site:reddit.com"` can yield helpful discussions or articles.
* Example resources:

    * [dev.to](https://dev.to/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles for use-cases or tutorials.

### 游늷 **Recommended Reading Strategy:**

1. **Start** with the **README.md** on GitHub for high-level understanding.
2. **Explore** the examples directory for practical applications.
3. **Dive deeper** by examining the inline documentation directly in `httplib.h`.
4. **Clarify** nuanced or edge-case questions by browsing through unit tests and GitHub issues.
5. **Supplement** with community-driven articles and tutorials if you need additional practical examples.
