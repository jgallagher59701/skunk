Given your clarification, here's the refined recommended setup specifically addressing your scenario clearly:

Your situation involves:

* Multiple web-service executables (small and targeted).
* Shared libraries sourced entirely from two existing GitHub repositories:

  * **Repository 1:** Provides a single library (`libdap4`).
  * **Repository 2 (`bes`):** Provides several libraries:

    * A **utility library** (common utilities).
    * Several other libraries (approximately 4â€“10).
* Not all code from these repositories is needed.

The most maintainable and cleanest way to manage this with **CMake** is as follows:

---

## âœ… **Proposed Directory Structure**

```plaintext
MyProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt                 # Root CMakeLists
â”œâ”€â”€ external/                      # External code repositories
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ libdap4/                   # Git submodule (single library)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bes/                       # Git submodule (multiple libraries)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/                      # Web service executables
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web_service_a/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web_service_b/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ src/
```

**Key points:**

* Libraries remain within the external repos. No need to copy files manually.
* Add the repositories as Git submodules for selective reuse.

---

## âœ… **Step 1: Adding External Repositories**

Initialize Git submodules:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/your_org/libdap4.git external/libdap4
git submodule add https://github.com/your_org/bes.git external/bes
```

---

## âœ… **Step 2: Top-Level CMake Configuration**

Your root `CMakeLists.txt` might look like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(MyWebServices LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# External Libraries (selective)
add_subdirectory(external/libdap4)
add_subdirectory(external/bes)

# Your Web Services
add_subdirectory(services/web_service_a)
add_subdirectory(services/web_service_b)
```

---

## âœ… **Step 3: Selectively Including External Libraries**

To handle external libraries, create tailored `CMakeLists.txt` within each external repo directory.

For instance:

### ðŸ”¸ **`external/libdap4/CMakeLists.txt`** (single library example):

```cmake
add_library(libdap4 STATIC)

target_sources(libdap4 PRIVATE
    src/dap4_file1.cpp
    src/dap4_file2.cpp
    # add only necessary source files
)

target_include_directories(libdap4 PUBLIC
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ **`external/bes/CMakeLists.txt`** (multiple libraries example):

Because `bes` contains multiple libraries, explicitly define them:

```cmake
# Utility Library
add_library(bes_utility STATIC)
target_sources(bes_utility PRIVATE
    utilities/src/util_file1.cpp
    utilities/src/util_file2.cpp
)
target_include_directories(bes_utility PUBLIC
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/utilities/include
)

# Other libraries from bes repo (example: bes_http, bes_data)
add_library(bes_http STATIC)
target_sources(bes_http PRIVATE
    http/src/http_file1.cpp
    # additional files...
)
target_include_directories(bes_http PUBLIC
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/http/include
)
target_link_libraries(bes_http PUBLIC bes_utility) # Example dependency

add_library(bes_data STATIC)
target_sources(bes_data PRIVATE
    data/src/data_file1.cpp
    # additional files...
)
target_include_directories(bes_data PUBLIC
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/data/include
)
target_link_libraries(bes_data PUBLIC bes_utility libdap4) # Dependencies
```

Repeat similarly for all needed libraries. Define clear dependencies.

---

## âœ… **Step 4: Web Service Executables Configuration**

Example: **`services/web_service_a/CMakeLists.txt`**

```cmake
add_executable(web_service_a)

target_sources(web_service_a PRIVATE
    src/main.cpp
    # additional source files
)

target_link_libraries(web_service_a PRIVATE
    libdap4
    bes_http
    bes_data
    bes_utility
    httplib  # assuming header-only httplib as an INTERFACE target
)
```

Repeat similarly for **`web_service_b`**, specifying appropriate library dependencies.

---

## âœ… **Step 5: Defining `cpp-httplib` as an INTERFACE Library (Recommended)**

Because **cpp-httplib** is header-only, set it as an INTERFACE target in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
# cpp-httplib INTERFACE target
add_library(httplib INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(httplib INTERFACE external/cpp-httplib)
```

Then simply link it to your targets as shown above.

---

## âœ… **Step 6: Building the Project**

Create and configure your build directory:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --parallel 4
```

---

## âœ… **Benefits of This Approach:**

* **Clean integration** of multiple external repositories via Git submodules.
* **Selective reuse**: Easily control precisely what you include from each external repository.
* **Shared libraries**: Clearly-defined dependencies, easy sharing between multiple web services.
* **Maintainable and scalable**: Adding more services or libraries later is straightforward.

---

## âœ… **Recommended Practices:**

* Keep **external repository modifications minimal** to easily handle upstream changes.
* Clearly comment and document each `CMakeLists.txt`.
* Regularly **update submodules** to incorporate external improvements:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

---

Following this structured and clearly-separated approach makes your project robust, scalable, and easily maintainable.
